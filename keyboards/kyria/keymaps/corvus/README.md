# Open Tasks and Ideas

* Consider moving away from double taps in favor of chording, sometimes.
* Fix the navigation functionality especially around editing,
  with command, option, shift, and the number keys.
* Move at least the copy/cut/paste shortcuts to the _left_ hand,
  so that they can be used in concert with a mouse.
* Reconsider the navigation functionality also of where the arrow keys live.
  It seemed intuitive to have left and right on the thumb,
  but up and down... it wasn't as clever as it sounded in my head.
* Fix caps lock at the bottom left corner.
* Reconsider placement of the option key, and all use of that innermost thumb position.'
* Nicer use of layer colors.
* More intentional arrangement of RGB, media, and function keys.
* Reduce file size to be able to use the leader key functionality.
* May like a different placement of the backspace key after all,
  once I get used to keeping my fingers exactly where they are.
  After all, who likes to stretch their pinky all the way up there,
  and as often as all that?
