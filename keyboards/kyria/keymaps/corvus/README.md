# Open Tasks and Ideas

* Consider moving away from double taps in favor of chording, sometimes.
* Fix the navigation functionality especially around editing,
  with command, option, shift, and the number keys.
* Control down, if not control up, for Mac use.
  (Edit: Actually it's fine because you can start with command-tab either way.)
* Command-shift-x for LastPass?
* Fix caps lock at the bottom left corner.
* Reconsider placement of the control key, and all use of that innermost thumb position.
* Nicer use of layer colors.
* More intentional arrangement of RGB, media, and function keys.
* Reduce file size to be able to use the leader key functionality.
* May like a different placement of the backspace key after all,
  once I get used to keeping my fingers exactly where they are.
  After all, who likes to stretch their pinky all the way up there,
  and as often as all that?
* Add emoji support, in some way?
  Consider even a smile, which should be an easy 2-key adjacent hop.
* Get back my unicode 2212 key?

# Ecosystem

* Get a longer TRRS cable so as to be able to move the halves of the keyboard
  farther apart.
* Figure out how to actually place my hands farther apart at my deskâ€¦
  like a very wide keyboard tray.
