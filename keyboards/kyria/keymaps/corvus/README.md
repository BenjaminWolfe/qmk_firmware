# Open Tasks and Ideas

* Consider moving _all_ modifiers from home row down one row.
  Perfect for Colemak, since the home row is so packed with rollover keys?
  Could also just be too far out of the way to do that across the board.
* Trying a new placement for backspace;
  I realize I don't really use space with my left thumb,
  and the previous backspace placement, left of the right-hand space key,
  wasn't working out.
  Too much thumb movement, too much finding the right spot after moving it,
  too much confusion, accidentally backspacing when I meant to space.
  I do use left-space when my right hand is on the mouse,
  and for that reason I've added it one thumb position out.
* For the moment I'm keeping backspace where it used to be as well,
  since I'm used to it.
  And doubled up backspace on the left because I sometimes miss the key.
* Consider using aliases for keys as outlined in the same article mentioned above.
  It certainly makes the code easier to read.
* Command-shift-x for 1Password?
* Nicer use of layer colors.
* More intentional arrangement of RGB, media, and function keys.
  Consider a way to print current color after querying HSV values:

* Reduce file size to be able to use the leader key functionality.
* Add emoji support, in some way?
  Consider even a smile, which should be an easy 2-key adjacent hop.
* Get back my unicode 2212 key?

# Ecosystem

* Get a longer TRRS cable so as to be able to move the halves of the keyboard
  farther apart.
* Figure out how to actually place my hands farther apart at my deskâ€¦
  like a very wide keyboard tray.
