# Open Tasks and Ideas

* Continue moving away from double taps in favor of chording.
* Although consider tweaking, as at COMBO_TERM 100 the functionality fires chords
  when I intend a quick roll. 50 seems to work nicely.
* Tap-dance term could use some tweaking, though, if I continue using the functionality.
* What about chording for shift in general??
  Or not even? Just using mod-tap?
  And what if I even used layer-tap for the symbols, without bothering with chords?
* Just not with `aeiousclynz`, which already have tap-and-hold functionality in MacOS.
  Or in the order they show up on the keyboard,
  `luy` (top row, RH), `asneio` (home row), and `zc` (bottom row, LH).
  Unfortunately, that takes away most of the convenient, symmetrical options on Colemak.
* Unless... we have a "safe layer" of the same letters with no mod-tap,
  just for when we want the far less common MacOS tap-and-hold combos.
* Command-shift-x for 1Password?
* Reconsider placement of the control key, and all use of that innermost thumb position.
* Nicer use of layer colors.
* More intentional arrangement of RGB, media, and function keys.
  Consider a way to print current color after querying HSV values:

* Reduce file size to be able to use the leader key functionality.
* Add emoji support, in some way?
  Consider even a smile, which should be an easy 2-key adjacent hop.
* Get back my unicode 2212 key?

# Ecosystem

* Get a longer TRRS cable so as to be able to move the halves of the keyboard
  farther apart.
* Figure out how to actually place my hands farther apart at my deskâ€¦
  like a very wide keyboard tray.
