# Open Tasks and Ideas

* Continue moving away from double taps in favor of chording.
* Although consider tweaking, as at COMBO_TERM 100 the functionality fires chords
  when I intend a quick roll. 50 seems to work nicely.
* Tap-dance term could use some tweaking, though, if I continue using the functionality.
* Need something a little different for Nav/Tab.
  Can't really work with the double-tapping there.
  What about a macro, that toggles command on and off when a key is pressed?
* Maybe move tabs in chrome and vscode layers up to normal left and right arrows.
* What about chording for shift in general??
  Or not even? Just using mod-tap?
  And what if I even used layer-tap for the symbols, without bothering with chords?
* Command-shift-x for 1Password?
* Reconsider placement of the control key, and all use of that innermost thumb position.
* Nicer use of layer colors.
* More intentional arrangement of RGB, media, and function keys.
* Reduce file size to be able to use the leader key functionality.
* Add emoji support, in some way?
  Consider even a smile, which should be an easy 2-key adjacent hop.
* Get back my unicode 2212 key?

# Ecosystem

* Get a longer TRRS cable so as to be able to move the halves of the keyboard
  farther apart.
* Figure out how to actually place my hands farther apart at my deskâ€¦
  like a very wide keyboard tray.
