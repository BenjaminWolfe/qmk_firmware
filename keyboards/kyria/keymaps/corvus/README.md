# Open Tasks and Ideas

* Continue moving away from double taps in favor of chording.
* Command-shift-x for 1Password?
* Reconsider placement of the control key, and all use of that innermost thumb position.
* Nicer use of layer colors.
* More intentional arrangement of RGB, media, and function keys.
* Reduce file size to be able to use the leader key functionality.
* Add emoji support, in some way?
  Consider even a smile, which should be an easy 2-key adjacent hop.
* Get back my unicode 2212 key?

# Ecosystem

* Get a longer TRRS cable so as to be able to move the halves of the keyboard
  farther apart.
* Figure out how to actually place my hands farther apart at my deskâ€¦
  like a very wide keyboard tray.
