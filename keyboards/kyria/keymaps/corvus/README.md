# Notes

* The specific configuration of home row modifiers
  is heavily influenced by this excellent article:
  https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods

# Open Tasks and Ideas

* Keep tinkering with positioning of thumb keys:
  space, delete, backspace, and tab.
* Consider auto-shift; nothing wrong with using that _and_ the modifier key.
* Consider using aliases for keys as outlined in the same article mentioned above.
  It certainly makes the code easier to read.
* Command-shift-x for 1Password?
* Nicer use of layer colors.
* More intentional arrangement of RGB, media, and function keys.
  Consider a way to print current color after querying HSV values:

* Reduce file size to be able to use the leader key functionality.
* Add emoji support, in some way?
  Consider even a smile, which should be an easy 2-key adjacent hop.
* Get back my unicode 2212 key?

# Things Decided Against

* Putting the modifiers all down one row from the home row.
  On Colemak this has the advantage of preventing nearly all rollover
  (which is a special problem for home row modifiers on Colemak,
  since all the most commonly rolled letters are in the home row!),
  but it loses the whole advantage of easy access that HROs promise.

# Ecosystem

* Get a longer TRRS cable so as to be able to move the halves of the keyboard
  farther apart.
* Figure out how to actually place my hands farther apart at my deskâ€¦
  like a very wide keyboard tray.
* Most importantly, be very sure I follow ergonomic best practices.
