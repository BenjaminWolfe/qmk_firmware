# Open Tasks and Ideas

* Consider control-option-shift-command all in the home row in that order,
  per the article linked in the comments to `config.h`.
  This would allow both option-shift and command-shift adjacent bars.
* Consider which of the home-row mods to duplicate on the right hand.
* Consider that the SYMBOLS layer could be activated from within NUMPAD.
* Or even split it into two layers, for symbols and for numbers,
  and/or use layer-taps on the default layer but one row down from home.
* Consider new placement of the backspace key, as it takes a moment
  to reposition the thumb afterward.
* Fix the escape functionality when KC_SWITCH has been pressed.
* Consider new placement of the caps lock key.
* Consider using aliases for keys as outlined in the same article mentioned above.
  It certainly makes the code easier to read.
* Command-shift-x for 1Password?
* Nicer use of layer colors.
* More intentional arrangement of RGB, media, and function keys.
  Consider a way to print current color after querying HSV values:

* Reduce file size to be able to use the leader key functionality.
* Add emoji support, in some way?
  Consider even a smile, which should be an easy 2-key adjacent hop.
* Get back my unicode 2212 key?

# Ecosystem

* Get a longer TRRS cable so as to be able to move the halves of the keyboard
  farther apart.
* Figure out how to actually place my hands farther apart at my deskâ€¦
  like a very wide keyboard tray.
